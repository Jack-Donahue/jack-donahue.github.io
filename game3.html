                        "Uprooted" is a game project developed collaboratively as part of a school assignment. The task involved 
                        choosing an existing game developed in Godot and recreating it from scratch in Unity without using the
                        original code. The primary goal was to create a faithful replica of the chosen game using Unity while avoiding 
                        any direct code transfer from the original project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project was divided into several key areas: Player,
                        Enemy, Level and Game States. But the most challenging part of this project was the time limit. As this was
                        one of many classes I had to take in a given semester, my workload was already large. We had only a couple
                        weeks to create this game, albeit a small one. Me and my partner overcame this through constant communication
                        whether it was status updates or assisting one another in their tasks that troubled them.
                    </p>

                        The key thing I learned through this project is just how valuable a second set of eyes can be in game development.
                        Sometimes as a programmer you can get tunnel vision and it's hard to get outside of that. Just having another
                        team member that can take a look at your code is so helpful and they can usually figure it out within minutes.
                        This was my first time working with somebody in Unity and I really enjoyed it.

                    I mentioned the state switching between the bird and the fish, but there was more going on then just simply
                    crossing the line sometimes. When the player is a bird, it would only switch into a fish if it's velocity
                    was almost 0. The reason for this was because the bird can actually dive by pressing return and eat a enemy fish
                    in order to remove competition (and your food bar fills up!). The game progressively gets harder as time goes by
                    because the fish and bird require more food to survive.
