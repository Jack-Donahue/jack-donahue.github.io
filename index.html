									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>
										I am a junior at Indiana University. I have a passion for problem solving, which I think is what made me want<br />
										to pursue my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I also have a minor in entrepreneurship and<br />
										small business management as well as in business. As a hobby I enjoy playing video games<br />
										which is probably what led me to getting a specialization in game development which are the projects you see on my portfolio.

										<h2>Space Fighters</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/SpaceFighter.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I made a Galaga style space shooter game using Unity. I made a player movement system. enemy spawner system, and a score system. The greatest obstacle I faced while making this game was the score system and its relationship with how frequently enemies spawned. I solved this by making a singleton that could hold the value of the state of the game.</p>

										<h2>Guess the Food!</h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/GuessTheFood!.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is my introduction into 3D game development using Unity. I created a movement system, a dialogue system, and a quiz system. I was able to create the quiz and movements systems quite easily. However, the dialogue took a lot of time to get used to. I eventually got around this be realizing I had to make certain parts of the game assigned to different events so I could separate the dialogue from the actual gameplay mechanics.</p>
