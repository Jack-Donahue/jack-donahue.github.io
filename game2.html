                    "Reflective" is a unique game that combines elements of air and water, where players control a bird in 
                    the air and a fish underwater. The primary objective is to maintain food levels for both the bird and
                    the fish while contending with enemy birds and fish. One of the major challenges was managing the game
                    state transitions between the bird and fish. Ensuring a seamless transition while keeping track of
                    variables like food levels and enemy behavior required careful planning. Implementing the core "reflective"
                    mechanic, where the player could switch between air and water, involved intricate coding and debugging.
                    Tracking player velocity and direction was essential for smooth state transitions. To solve the transition
                    between the bird and the fish, a robust state management system was developed. It took into account player
                    input, velocity, and collision detection. Detecting when the player crossed the air-water boundary helped 
                    control the reflective mechanic.

                    I mentioned the state switching between the bird and the fish, but there was more going on then just simply
                    crossing the line sometimes. When the player is a bird, it would only switch into a fish if it's velocity
                    was almost 0. The reason for this was because the bird can actually dive by pressing return and eat a enemy fish
                    in order to remove competition (and your food bar fills up!). The game progressively gets harder as time goes by
                    because the fish and bird require more food to survive.
