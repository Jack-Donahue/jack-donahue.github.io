                <p>
                    Go! Save the Queen is an escort tower defense game with a buggy theme. Protect the queen from enemy insects
                    with your own ant units. Each unit and enemy has their own unique skillset so make sure to place them down
                    strategically. My role in this game focused on the enemies and the VFX. The following videos will help
                    demonstrate how the game works and I will point out the specific features that I created.

                            are place in their path to protect her. There are small VFX that are played when an enemy dies, does a special ability,
                            or is hit by a certain buff or debuff. There are multiple enemies on display here such as the bee, stinkbug, flea, and
                            praying mantis. The bee doesn't attack, but instead drops honey on unsuspecting players to slow their movement or attack speed.
                            The stinkbug charges towards the queen and drops a gas cloud that damages the queen over time and decreases visibility. Lastly,
                            the flea has a very high movement speed and little health and tries to attach itself to the queen, damaging her every second it
                            can stay attached.
