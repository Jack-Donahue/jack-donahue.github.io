                    "Billionaire" was conceived as a school project and evolved into a 2D multiplayer game where four 
                    bases called Billionaires spawned units called Billions that employed physics to shoot projectiles at opposing teams. 
                    The primary objective was to be the last team standing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Every week, our professor would show us new developments in the game that we had to indivudually
                    replicate. Over time it became  a full-fledged game, "Billionaire".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    "Billionaire" allowed four players to control bases that spawned billions, each using physics to 
                    interact with the environment and engage in combat. The primary goal was to eliminate the opposing 
                    teams and be the last team remaining. Power-ups were implemented to enhance gameplay and strategy.
                    In the current build, only two out of the four players could move. If I were to continue developing 
                    the game, I would definitely consider transitioning into a single-player game with AI-controlled 
                    bases, allowing for a more accessible and engaging experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, I definitely faced challenges. A lot of these implementations were things I was not
                    familiar with whatsoever. Two tasks that I struggled with were the power ups and experience 
                    points of the billions. The billions that would spawn after a base leveled up had to replicate 
                    the level of that base. I would keep spawning in new billions that were either at level 1, or 
                    the  billions that were previously spawned in would have their XP all of the sudden increase. 
                    After plenty of debugging I was able to create the level on the base and then give the billion
                    it's own level during Instantiation. The power ups were difficult because the ideas that I had
                    were beyond the scope of my project. I wasted a lot of time trying methods that would surely have 
                    taken me tens of hours to complete. I ended up making a cool power up where a special projectile 
                    would hit an enemy billion, and that billion would change sides and start attacking it's own teammates.

                    <p>
                    Although I had my fair share of struggles, I can without a doubt say that I learned more during
                    this single project about Unity than any other class or project I have worked on!

                    This game had many mechanics but there are a few I want to highlight because it may be hard to tell
                    what's going on just by watching. The red and yellow billions are the only ones that move. They move
                    to the closest flag of their color using the left and right click. Obviously a completed game would 
                    have the CPUs moving around as well. To keep it short, the green ring around the base is it's health,
                    there is also a white ring inside the green ring that keeps track of XP. The white ring around the
                    smaller units is signifying the level. You will see the ring turn black and then yellow and there are
                    10 colors that show the level of the billion, with increased damage and health. Lastly, the power up box
                    spawns a single billion with a different cannon to shoot the betrayal projectile.
