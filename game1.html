                    "Billionaire" was conceived as a school project and evolved into a 2D multiplayer game where four 
                    bases spawned billions of units that employed physics to shoot projectiles at opposing teams. 
                    The primary objective was to be the last team standing.

                    Every week, our professor would show us new developments in the game that we had to indivudually
                    replicate. Over time it became  a full-fledged game, "Billionaire".

                    "Billionaire" allowed four players to control bases that spawned billions, each using physics to 
                    interact with the environment and engage in combat. The primary goal was to eliminate the opposing 
                    teams and be the last team remaining. Power-ups were implemented to enhance gameplay and strategy.
                    In the current build, only two out of the four players could move.If I were to continue developing the game,
                    I would definitely consider transitioning into a single-player game with AI-controlled bases,
                    allowing for a more accessible and engaging experience.

                    However, I definitely faced challenges. A lot of these implementations were things I were not familiar
                    with whatsoever. Two tasks that I struggled with were the power ups and experience of the billions. The billions
                    that would spawn after a base leveled up had to replicate the level of that base. I would keep spawning in 
                    new billions that had either level 1, or the billions that were previously spawned in would have their XP
                    all of the sudden increase. After plenty of debugging I was able to create the level on the base and then
                    give the billion it's own level during Instantiation. The power ups were difficult because the ideas that I had
                    were beyond the scope of my project. I wasted a lot of time trying methods that would surely have taken me tens of hours
                    to complete. I ended up making a cool power up where the special projectile would hit an enemy billion, and that billion
                    would change sides and start attacking it's own team mates. Although I had my fair share of struggles, I can without
                    a doubt say that I learned more during this single project about Unity than any other class or project I have worked on!
